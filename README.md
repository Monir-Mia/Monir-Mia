# 👋 Hi, I’m @Monir-Mia

I’m a passionate **WordPress Web Developer**, focused on creating fast, responsive, and SEO-optimized websites using Elementor and custom design techniques.

- 👨‍💻 I work on full-site development — from domain/hosting setup, cPanel configuration, to custom WordPress design.
- 👀 I’m interested in WordPress development, UI/UX design, and frontend performance.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced WordPress optimization and plugin customization.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on professional WordPress websites and creative UI-based projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Visit My Website](https://abezam.com) or email me at: `hello@abezam.com`
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love building full websites manually without using pre-made themes — every site I build is custom-crafted for performance and design.

### 🛠 Technical Skills (Beyond Design)

I also have hands-on experience managing websites from the **server side**, especially with **cPanel**. I regularly handle:

- Domain & hosting setup, DNS configuration  
- Email setup and routing via cPanel  
- SSL certificate installation and renewal  
- Site migration and backup using cPanel tools  
- Handling PHP versions, resource limits, and security settings  
- Fixing technical issues like white screen, 500 errors, and permission errors

These allow me to provide **end-to-end solutions**, not just design.

### 🔎 Bonus Skills
While development is my primary area, I also understand the essentials of SEO and digital strategy — especially in areas where **tech meets growth** (like performance optimization and tracking integrations).

Thanks for stopping by!  
Let’s build something awesome together. 🚀
